## User Impact

Observed weaknesses in email authentication controls reduce the reliability of sender trust validation and increase the likelihood of unauthorized or malicious emails reaching end users.

These conditions elevate organizational risk by:
- Increasing exposure to phishing and impersonation attempts
- Undermining user confidence in email communications
- Raising the probability of credential compromise through social engineering
- Expanding the attack surface for business email–based threats

No direct evidence of account compromise was identified during this assessment; however, the absence or failure of enforced authentication controls materially weakens preventative email security measures and places greater reliance on user awareness and downstream filtering mechanisms.
